# ✅ Hardcoded Data Removed - All Sections Now Dynamic

## 🎉 **All Components Now Fetch from Database!**

I've removed all hardcoded data from the following sections. Everything now comes from the admin dashboard!

## 📝 **Updated Components**

### **1. Services Component** ✅
**File**: `src/components/Services.jsx`

- ✅ Displays loading state
- ✅ Shows "No services yet" if empty
- ✅ Safe JSON parsing for features
- ✅ Dynamic numbering (01, 02, 03...)

**Now Shows:**

### **2. Skills Component** ✅

**After**:

**Categories Are Dynamic:**
Whatever categories you add in the admin (Frontend, Backend, Design, etc.) will automatically create new sections!

### **3. About Component** ✅
**File**: `src/components/About.jsx`

**Before**:
- Hardcoded bio text
- Placeholder "JU" image

- ✅ Shows "No info yet" if empty
- ✅ Profile image from database
- ✅ Dynamic name and title
