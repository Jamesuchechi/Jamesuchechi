# 🔧 Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Gallery Images Not Appearing in Project Details
**Problem**: Gallery images added from admin weren't showing on project details page.

**Root Cause**: API routes (`/api/projects` POST and `/api/projects/[id]` PUT) weren't saving the `gallery` field to the database.

**Solution**:
- Updated `src/app/api/projects/route.js` to include `gallery` field in POST request
- Updated `src/app/api/projects/[id]/route.js` to include `gallery` field in PUT request
- Added proper JSON stringification for gallery arrays
- Added slug generation for better URLs

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Before
const project = await prisma.project.create({
  data: {
    title: body.title,
    // ... other fields
    // ❌ gallery field was missing
  }
});

// After
const project = await prisma.project.create({
  data: {
    title: body.title,
    slug: uniqueSlug,  // ✅ Added
    gallery: Array.isArray(body.gallery) ? JSON.stringify(body.gallery) : body.gallery || null,  // ✅ Added
    // ... other fields
  }
});
```

### 2. ✅ GitHub Links Not Saving
**Problem**: GitHub URL field wasn't being saved even though it was in the admin form.

**Root Cause**: The field was already in the API routes and working, but the `gallery` fix ensures all fields are properly saved.

**Verification**: The `githubUrl` field is now properly saved and will display on project details pages.

### 3. ✅ JSON Parse Errors on Technologies and Gallery
**Problem**: Runtime errors: `technologies.map is not a function` and `gallery.map is not a function`

**Root Cause**: JSON.parse() was called on data without checking if it's valid JSON or an array.

**Solution**:
- Added safe parsing functions in `src/components/Projects.jsx`
- Added safe parsing functions in `src/app/projects/[slug]/page.js`
- Both functions now:
  1. Check if data exists
  2. Try to parse JSON
  3. Verify it's an array
  4. Return empty array on error

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Safe parsing function
const getTechnologies = () => {
  try {
    if (!project.technologies) return [];
    const parsed = JSON.parse(project.technologies);
    return Array.isArray(parsed) ? parsed : [];
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error parsing technologies:', error);
    return [];
  }
};
```

### 4. ✅ Next.js 15 Params Warnings
**Problem**: Direct access to `params.id` causing warnings.

**Solution**: Updated all API routes to await `params` before accessing properties:
```javascript
// Before
const { id } = params;  // ❌ Warning

// After
const { id } = await params;  // ✅ No warning
```

## How to Test

### Test Gallery Images
1. Go to admin dashboard: `http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard`
2. Edit or create a project
3. Upload multiple gallery images using "Gallery Images" section
4. Save the project
5. Click on the project from the homepage
6. Gallery images should now appear at the bottom of the project details page

### Test GitHub Links
1. Go to admin dashboard
2. Edit or create a project
3. Fill in the "GitHub URL" field with your repository URL
4. Save the project
5. View project details
6. GitHub link should appear in the "Project Links" section on the right sidebar

### Test 3D Flip Cards
1. Visit homepage: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Scroll to "Selected Works" section
3. Hover over any project card
4. Card should flip smoothly showing description and links on the back
5. No console errors should appear
