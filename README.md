# Hi, I'm James 👋  
*Data Scientist | Software Developer | Insight Hunter*

Welcome to my corner of GitHub, where code meets curiosity. I'm a software developer with a deep love for **data science**, and I thrive at the intersection of **machine learning, clean code, and real-world problem solving**.

## 🧠 What I Do
- 🔍 Explore, analyze, and wrangle data like a detective
- 🤖 Build ML models that don’t just work, but scale
- 🛠️ Develop data-driven applications from prototype to production
- 📊 Communicate insights through visualizations and storytelling

## 💼 Current Focus
- 🔬 LLMs and Generative AI (beyond the hype)
- 🧱 Building robust data pipelines (Airflow, dbt, the whole stack)
- 🧮 Making statistical models explainable and actionable
- 🌍 Real-world problems in [fintech, health, climate]

## 🧰 Tech Stack
`Python` `R` `SQL` `Pandas` `scikit-learn` `PyTorch` `Docker` `PostgreSQL`  
`FastAPI` `Jupyter` `Airflow` `dbt` `Git` `Linux`
